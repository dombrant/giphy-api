# Giphy API

A simple Node.js server that makes a request to the Giphy API. The request fetches 25 GIFs, and a random one is returned. The default route will return a Chris Farley GIF. Alternatively, the user may search for a GIF based on the URL they type (i.e. localhost:3000/star+wars will search for Star Wars GIFs). The main branch uses Express, while the koa branch uses Koa.
